# Periodic-Table
I have created the Periodic Table using Vanilla JS which displays the atomic name, number, weight and its family.

I have created it in HatchXR.com

The provided JavaScript code uses event listeners to create interactive behavior for HTML elements representing chemical elements. 

When the user hovers over an element (`mouseenter` event), the code changes its opacity to give a highlighted effect and updates various text fields with specific details about the element, such as its name, symbol, atomic number, mass value, and type. When the mouse leaves the element (`mouseleave` event), the opacity is reset to its original state, and the highlighting effect is removed. 

This allows for a dynamic and responsive user interface that provides real-time information as the user interacts with different elements.
